<b> 3 of Steve Jobs great innovations</b> <br>
<ul>
<li> Macintosh: A great leap in the career of Steve Jobs was the introduction of the original Macintosh (1984), the first consumer computer with a graphical user interface. In other words, it had an operating system with windows and icons, and a mouse to move between them. This idea did not originate with Steve Jobs.  But Jobs managed to pack them all into a revolutionary computer, adding a few touches of his own.</li> <br>
<li>
  Typography on screen: One of the major innovations of the original Macintosh was it's ability to show on-screen the font chosen for the text. In the past, what was drawn on computer screens was just like on a typewriter. Steve Jobs insisted that the first Mac had the ability to display different fonts. He explained in his famous speech at Stanford University, this inspiration came from his time at college where he decided to take a course in calligraphy.
  </li> <br>
<li>
  iMac (1998) + iPod (2001) + iPad (2010): These three devices were reinventions of three devices that Steve deemed to be stagnant and/or useless: the personal computer, the MP3 player and the tablet PC. In all three cases his strategy was the same. He led teams of talented designers and software engineers and had them invent more and more prototypes with two main focuses simplicity and beauty.
